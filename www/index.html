    INTRO
    This is the source for SorryDeck.com, which provides a virtual card deck for Hasbro's well-loved
    Sorry!(r) game. It is designed to be accessed on a mobile phone that is placed on the middle of the
    board game where both parents and kids can see it and take turns touching the screen, drawing the
    next card.

    LICENSE AND TRADEMARK
    Sorry! is a registered trademark of Hasbro, Inc.  The basic card design is copyright by Hasbro. Because
    I am not creating a full virtual game and this virtual deck can ONLY be used by people who buy a game from
    Hasbro, including a copy of the paper deck, I believe this qualifies as fair use. I have no intent to
    complete with Hasbro. If they provide their own Sorry! deck that works well for the iPhone, even if it
    costs a couple of dollar, I will change this site to point to their app.

    HISTORY
    I run my own software company, Infinite Stairway LLC. Because of the social distancing required by
    covid-19, I started spending more time with my kids, especially playing board games (the silver lining
    of the clouds). This game is a family favorite. Even my wife likes it. We sometimes play it on dates. When
    she was in the labor and delivery room for our third baby, I entertained her by buying a special
    edition of Sorry! and playing it with her to keep her mind from the long delivery. In fact, I was
    holding that baby when our family placed Sorry! for the first time using SorryDeck.com--on the same
    day our baby took her first steps!

    I love this game, but after I read in the NYT that it takes a minimum of 7 shuffles to get a truly
    random order, and being a stickler for fairness, shuffling started to take a long time. (See
    https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/09/science/in-shuffling-cards-7-is-winning-number.html.) One day when
    playing with my five-year-old, inspiration struck me. I made her wait 10 minutes--which she thought was
    forever--while I created a C# Windows Forms game. It worked, but she didn't like it. Two iterations
    later I came up with this, which she thinks is cool.

    Enjoy! And spend some time with your kids!

    <!-- This implements three card faces:
        1. The back side (which is green)
        2. The number card
        3. The Sorry!(r) card, which is formatted differently from the number card.

        JavaScript is used to switch between the cards and to set the number and instructions on the number card.

        The star background in the center of the cards is implemented using three squares--one normal
        one, one that is rotated 120 degrees, and another that is rotated 240 degrees.
